# Description and explanation
This code offers various encryption and scrambling techniques for digital image security. In the encryption methods (Logistic map, Henon map, and AES encryption), each pixel value of the image is individually encrypted using a mathematical equation to produce the encrypted image. Conversely, in the scrambling techniques (Arnold transformation and Hyperchaotic Chen system), the positions of the pixel values are rearranged to create the scrambled image without altering the pixel values themselves. Both approaches are reversible, allowing the original image to be recovered from the encrypted or scrambled version.
The images in the "Image" folder were obtained from the USC-SIPI Image Database: https://sipi.usc.edu/database/database.php
